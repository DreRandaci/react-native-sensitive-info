RNSInfo is an open-source library developed by many contributors since 2016. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Securing sensitive data is very important in production-ready applications. So, this is why RNSInfo was created for, to help you focus in what matters most, your application. üòâ

Handling sensitive data couldn't be easier in React-Native apps.

## Demo

```js
import SInfo from "react-native-sensitive-info";

const savingFirstData = await SInfo.setItem("key1", "value1", {
  sharedPreferencesName: "mySharedPrefs",
  keychainService: "myKeychain",
});

console.log(savingFirstData); //value1

// Need to retrieve later?

const gettingFirstData = await SInfo.getItem("key1", {
  sharedPreferencesName: "mySharedPrefs",
  keychainService: "myKeychain",
});

console.log(gettingFirstData); //value1

//Need to get all values stored?

const gettingAllKeys = await SInfo.getAllItems({
  sharedPreferencesName: "mySharedPrefs",
  keychainService: "myKeychain",
});

console.log(gettingAllKeys); //value1
```
